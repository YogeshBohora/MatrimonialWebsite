    <p>Match Making with Cosine Similarity is an online web-based platform which includes essential information of particular person in one profile, where all information posted by users will be displayed. People can see what they can expect from their partner. On top of that, the users can create matrimonial profiles. The system recommends the partners by analysing user profiles on the basis of location, age and religion they follow. This system aims to match the bride to groom and vice versa to share their requirement of an ideal partner. Moreover, the quality of recommendation in this system is directly proportional to the similar interest of the users. For the recommendation, this system implements Cosine Similarity Algorithm in order to filter the groups of users with similar interest. So that these filtered values help to recommend the profiles based on their location, age, qualification and religion of the individual. We expect that this system will help bridge the gap between bride and groom searching for similar interest in short period of time.</p>
